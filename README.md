# Notes

BBC launch along with team scientists launched world biggest climate predicting project
Use advance program to produce a accurate model of our future climate
To get accurete prediction must run the program as many time as possible, in severals computers, 56k help

## Temperature

 - In 2020 the UK will be increase the temperature in 1.2C sice 1970. Sounds small, but the system is complex
 - In august, 2003 during heatwave, 35k across the europe died from heat
 - Is predicted by 2020, heatwaves will be 25 times more likely
 - The impact will be felt most in our cities because the hurban heat island because the buldings are man-made surfaces that absorb much more heat that green places do, specialy in underground.
 - In july 2001, 14k people were trapped for 90m, temperatures soared to 40 degrees. 17 people was taken to hospital and 6 houndred were treated for heat problems

## flooding

 - Its not only the temperature that is change, the flooding is another example of climate changes
 - If you live with a river at the end, but recent statistics shows that a quarter of households that get flooded are in towns and cities
where the threat doesn't come from the river it comes from sewagei
 - One example of that , in 2002 a city called Glasgow, the root cause of the disaster was the prolonged heavy rain. New research reveals that in 90s was almost 79% wetter that in any previous three decades.
 - The data its predicted that by 2020 will get more heavy rain during the winter

## 2050

 - The results show that in 2050 the temperature will be rise in 2.5 degress

## Natural Environment

 - Severals species is so adapted to environment that a big change in short time will getting out of step.
For instance the patarmigan, a bird so adapted to landscape that it actually turns white every winter. The climate change will make it more vulnerable to predators
