BBC launch along with team scientists launched world biggest climate predicting project
Use advance program to produce a accurate model of our future climate
To get accurete prediction must run the program as many time as possible, in severals computers, 56k help

# Temperature

in 2020 the UK will be increase the temperature in 1.2C sice 1970
Sounds small, but the system is complex

-- images temp

In august, 2003 during heatwave, 35k across the europe died from heat
Is predicted by 2020, heatwaves will be 25 times more likely

The impact will be felt most in our cities because the hurban heat island because the buldings are man-made surfaces that absorb much more heat that green places do, specialy in underground
I july 2001, 14k people were trapped for 90m, temperatures soared to 40 degrees. 17 people was taken to hospital and 6 houndred were treated for heat problems

# flooding
Its not only the temperature that is change, the flooding is another example of climate changes
If you live with a river at the end, but recent statistics shows that a quarter of households that get flooded are in towns and cities
where the threat doesn't come from the river it comes from sewagei
One example of that , in 2002 a city called Glasgow, the root cause of the disaster was the prolonged heavy rain. New research reveals that in 90s was almost 79% wetter that in any previous three decades.

The data its predicted that by 2020 will get more heavy rain during the winter

# 2050
The results show that in 2050 the temperature will be rise in 2.5 degress

# Natural Environment

Severals species is so adapted to environment that a big change in short time will getting out of step.
For instance the patarmigan, a bird so adapted to landscape that it actually turns white every winter. The climate change will make it more vulnerable to predators
